Current Implementation of the GPU Gfunction, which matches the CPU implementation
This is a preliminary version in which only the xyz data and gfunction are shared.
Basic Algorithm for G function:
	Loop Through Each Atom
		Loop Through Each Sequence (e.g. 00, 0H) in order specified
			For each Sequence, launch the correct Kernel (either angular or radial)
			

In the kernel:
	Each thread deals with a seperate cluster	
	Load the relevant xyz coordinates into shared memory.
	Calculate the results and store in shared memory
	Put results back into global memory

Results:
